# JS Skeleton Repo

Skeleton repo for starting JS projects, to be copied and adapted as needed.

It contains Jest for testing, Prettier for linting. There is also a basic Github actions CI pipeline.

## Get started

The default entry file `index.js`. This can be run with

```
npm run start
npm run dev # uses nodemon
```

To set up express server, use the `app.js` and `server.js` files.

```
npm run server
npm run server:dev # uses nodemon
```

## Possible future features

- CI examples for other pipeline tools:
  - GitLab
  - Jenkins
  - CircleCI
- Dockerfile
- Save / show test coverage output
